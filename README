##2023_Osteoporosis_STARRseq

This folder contains four subdirectories for integrative analytical pipeline of dissecting molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying osteoporosis-associated SNPs. We provided multiomics data (Hi-C, ChiP-seq) in osteoblast cells and precomputed multi-layer gene functional analyses results (e.g., TWAS/colocation/IMPC) relevant to osteoporosis. Alternatively, you can replace these annotation files with user-defined files for expanded application for GWAS SNPs associated with other human complex diseases.

1) <<functional.SNP.analysis>>
An integrative shell script outputting epigenetic characterization, Hi-C promoter chromatin interacted genes and their osteoporosis-relevant functional annotation (pathway enrichment), allelic motif prediction and enrichment with any user-defined interested SNPs and background (optional) SNPs as input.

2) <<HiC.genes.functional.analysis>>
Two python scripts for separate analyses of Hi-C promoter chromatin interacted genes and motif prediction and enrichment with any user-defined interested SNPs and background (optional) SNPs as input.

3) <<STARRseq.analysis>>
Scripts for calling SNP reads from raw sequencing files of STARR-seq assay, identifying putative enhancer SNP fragment (eSNP) and identifying of SNPs with biased allelic enhancer activity effect (baaSNP).

4) <<TF.network.analysis>>
Scripts for allelic motif prediction and enrichment analyses from user-defined interested SNPs and background SNPs as input, and following TF regulatory network analyses (target gene identification, TF scoring)

##Getting Started

In order to download 2023_Osteoporosis_STARRseq, you can clone this repository via the commands  
git clone https://github.com/xjtugenetics/2023_Osteoporosis_STARRseq.git

#dowload human genome sequence (fasta, hg19) from public resources(e.g.,UCSC) and replace it with All-chromosome.fa
cd ./TF.network.analysis/1.motif.enrichment/1.allelic.motif.prediction/files/motif_database
wget -c https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/latest/hg19.fa.gz
mv hg19.fa.gz All-chromosome.fa.gz

Some R packages and python dependencies need are listed below.
*R  v3.4.1 (packages: clusterProfiler, DOSE, exact2x2, ggplot2, limma, MPRAnalyze, org.Hs.eg.db, patchwork, ReactomePA, Rgraphviz)
*Python v2.7.16 (packages: numpy, BioPython)
*bedtools   v2.29.0
*fimo   v5.4.1  (from meme suite toolkit)
*bowtie2 v2.4.1

Once above configuration completed, you can enter each directory and run corresponding script like                                        
./functional.SNP.analysis/SNP.osteoporosis.functional.analysis.sh -h to print a list of all command-line options. For each directory, example input file and prepared annotation files for script test are also provided.
